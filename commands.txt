# For your assignment:
# Create the appropriate models and the appropriate relationship.
# Design your models so that the following command would be supported
#   Book.objects.first().uploader - this should return the user who uploaded the book
#   User.objects.first().uploaded_books - this should return all the books that are uploaded by the first user
#   Book.objects.first().liked_users - this should return all the users who liked the first book
#   User.objects.first().liked_books - this should return all the books that were liked by the first user
# Create 3 different user accounts
